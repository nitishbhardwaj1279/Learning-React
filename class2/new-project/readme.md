//React.createElement  crates a reactelement which is obj but when we render this obj on dom it becomes html element

/when we do root.render() it will take react element which is obj and convert it into html element

//NOTE -JSX IS NOT HTML INSIDE JS IT IS A HTML LIKE SYNTAXX ,JSX IS DIFF AND HTML IS DIFF 


//JSX IS JS SYNTAX WHICH IS EASIER FOR CREATING REACT ELEMENTS ,JSX IS NOT PART OF REACT BOTH ARE SEPARATE

//WE CAN WRITE REACT WITHOUT JSX ALSO ITS JUST JSX PROVIDE EASIER SYANTAX TO WRITE REACT CODE

//we can have {} inside jsx and inside {} we can have any js code
//we can have react element inside  fnal component or we can also have fnal component inside fnal component
